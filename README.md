## To-Do :

#### - Style Homepage add login / signin

#### - Add user profile and redirect to profile after google auth.

#### - Show/Hide Flashcards unless user is signed in.

#### - Backend - I don't think current method of getting data from backend is most efficient - look for alternatives.

#### - Flash card groups (maybe)

### - When flashcard is clicked it changes color

- react
- redux
- javascript
- node
- html and css

---

## Frontend :

### Setup: use npm install followed by npm start. Runs on localhost:3000

- React
- react-bootstrap for Navbar, Buttons, and the Question Choices

## Backend :

### Setup: npm install followed by npm start (will run with nodemon). Runs on localhost:8000

- passport
- mongodb
- node
- express
- OAuth with google

---

### Research:

- Procfile
- Deploy Mern Stack application

### Miscellaneous :

to add user/username to backend models, routes, and server.js

if user/username is added to backend,then will have to use postman /POST to update database.
